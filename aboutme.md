## Who am I?

My name is Milena, and I'm a <b>Full-Stack Developer</b> based in Argentina, and I'm currently pursuing an <b>Associate's Degree in Programming</b> at the <i>Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional</i>. I used to be a self-taught developer, but after over a year of working in the field and finding great opportunities, I decided to study at a university to gain another perspective on the field.

Besides my career, I'm passionate about other things! I love spending time with my partner, creating my own songs and doing covers, cooking delicious meals, writing, and cuddling with my cat.

## What will you find here?
I really enjoy writing, and I'm not just talking about code: I also like expressing my thoughts in words.

I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences as a developer, a student, and a human being living in this generation. Who knows, maybe someone will read it and relate!

I always enjoyed writing, and I find it therapeutic and relaxing. I write lines of code (almost) every day, but I don't usually write about my thoughts or experiences, so I wanted to give it a shot.

My native language is Spanish, but I'm a C2 level in English, and there are some days that I use it even more than my mother tongue. Since I'm comfortable and familiar with it, I decided to pick it as my blog's language.

Sometimes we worry too much about the profit of our actions. <i>"Writing a blog? No one reads them nowadays, what a waste of time!"</i>, and we forget to do engage in activities for the mere pleasure of it. These are questions that I ask myself sometimes, but then I remember that we also have to do things for ourselves, just because they are good for us.

So, here I am, writing words that might get lost on the net, just because it brings me comfort. And what are they about? Probably about software development, GNU/Linux, and my own reflections and personal thoughts.
